/**
 * Given an array, s, of n real number strings, sort them in descending order â€” but wait, there's more! Each number must be printed
 * in the exact same format as it was read from stdin, meaning that is .1 printed as .1, and 0.1 is printed as 0.1.
 * If two numbers represent numerically equivalent values (e.g., .1 = 0.1), then they must be listed in the same order as they were received as input).
 * Complete the code in the unlocked section of the editor below. You must rearrange array 's elements according to the instructions above.
